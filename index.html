          Today, we will explore how different users interact with a public
          interface. I chose one familiar to me: a boba tea place self-order
          kiosk. While it's a fairly simple interface, it can lead to a lot of
          potential interactions: what do new users feel? What about the
          experienced ones? How does the payment/confirmation system work?
          Today, we will explore some of these questions and how this kiosk
          addresses them!

            screen to navigate the menu, choose a drink, customize it,

              <p>User 3: I am not too worried about the speed of the order, but I don't want to feel pressure from talking to a person at the counter</p>

              <p>User 2: It is important to me that the kiosk would show pictures of the drink I am getting</p>
              <p>User 3: For me, it was the inherent feature of kiosk that allows you to fully control your order</p>

              <p>User 1: Very important since default settings drinks are too sweet for me most of the time</p>
              <p>User 2: I never order pre-determined drinks (as in default settings), so I would say it is important for me</p>
              <p>User 3: I would say it is quite important for me because it allows to experiment with different tastes</p>

            <li><strong>To each their own:</strong> Almost all interviewed users had a different primary focus: drink parameteres, ability to browse, or control over your order</li>
            <li><strong>Less talking:</strong> A common topic was also the chance not to talk to staff: for many it's less awkward and provides more info about their drinks</li>
            <li><strong>Power in numbers:</strong> There was a lot of enjoyment from choice, as a lot of conversations hit topics like customization, drink parameters, and rewards</li>

            <p> Ethan is a Brown University Computer Science student with a sweet tooth. He tries not to spend too much on Boba, but it’s hard to resist. 
              He usually visits one to two times a week after his afternoon class. 
              When he comes in, the interface is familiar to him: he enters the phone number to get that free drink soon, quickly navigates to his favorite drink, and selects desired sugar level, boba, and milk options. 
              Sometimes, he is a bit upset that there is no default order to save, so the process takes the same amount of steps every time.

            <p> Alice takes good care of her diet and likes to know the details about her food and drinks.
              She appreciates a good drink but visits a similar place about once a month. 
              As a first time user, she got a little perplexed by the “Enter phone number" screen, and took a second to find the cancel button. 
              She wanted to filter the drinks based on calories or other criteria, but could not find the button for it. 
              After getting to the payment screen, she instinctively moved to the bottom, bud didn't find the payment device. </p>
